<p>
This is my portfolio page. I decided to have a little fun with it and integrate a Star Wars-like theme. 
You may not get the full effect because the main font "Distant Galaxy" is almost definitely installed on your computer.
Near the bottom of the page I have provided links to my main projects and also provided pictures from another project that I 
collaborated on at The Tech Academy. In addition the footer contains the many ways you can contact me along with links to my GitHub page.
